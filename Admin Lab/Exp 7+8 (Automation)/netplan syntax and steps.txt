- Make sure you set the network to Bridge Adapter.
- Make sure the interface (like enp0s3 or others) is the one assigned with the IP address
- Make sure you're connected to the lab network, not the university network.
- In Windows configurations, always pay attention to the DNS settings in all casesâ€”whether it's a File Server, Domain Controller, or even a Client.
